## Usage 

To use the loan qualifier application, simply clone the repository and run the **app.py**, import the daily_rate_sheet.csv, and fill in the prompts with the user's input. If the user qualifies for a loan and would like to save the results as a CSV file, answer yes when prompted and create a name for the new file.
